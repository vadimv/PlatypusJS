# PlatypusJS
The Platypus Platform is a JavaScript client and server applications platform for rapid development of enterprise-level information systems.
The platform uses two application programming languages:
* JavaScript (compatible with the ECMA-262-3 standard) is used to write program logic.
* SQL is used to access data.

Application creation and editing, deployment, debugging and maintenance are performed using the Platypus Application Designer IDE based on the NetBeans Platform. However, individual files, for example, JavaScript modules, can be edited in any text editor.

The IDE includes following development tools:

* Application database structure visual editor.
* SQL queries visual editor.
* JavaScript code editor.
* User interface forms visual editor.

The platform offers a set of features, making development process extremely productive:
* JavaScript modules automatic dependencies resolving, manual resolving is also avaliable.
* SQL queries with named parameters and SQL clauses re-use.
* Data model and ORM (Object-Relation Mapping) for JavaScript.
* Desktop cross-platform as well as HTML5 web-browser user interface presentation sharing the same code and the GUI layout.
* The GUI widgets which directly interact with the data model, allowing implementation of a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) user interface with visual configuration and without or just a little coding.
* Built-in security support, including users authentication and authorization, constraints of access to application resources.
* Application database schema structure and initial applicaton data migrations tools.
